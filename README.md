# Hugo Houdini’s Half-Way Haunted House


*Hugo Houdini’s Half-Way Haunted House is an addictive text-based adventure through the “haunted” mansion of Harry Houdini’s younger
brother, Hugo.  The player is a teenager exploring the halls of the house encountering monsters and ghosts, and the player
will need to figure out what is real, and what is just Steve the gas station attendant in cheap makeup.  Clues to the
houses sorted past will reveal themselves as the player progresses through the house, and the player will need to
discover the truth in order for the spirits of the house to rest.*

October 31, 1998, Spookstown, Ohio.

Spookstown’s local tourist attraction is back up and running. Hugo Houdini’s Haunted House, named after the less 
notable brother of the famous magician, is drawing in the crowds with its cheesy scares and frights. Screams of joyous 
terror can be heard by those waiting in line to enter.



A teenager is next in line, unaware they are about to enter into the adventure of a life, or perhaps their afterlife.
